# Pi-in-the-Sky

In this research project, I combine the latest deeplearning models for computer vision together with a camera-augmented Raspberry Pi, to enable a modified RC plane to identify people, objects, and targets from the sky.

The fundamental research problem addressed in this study is: investigating the tradeoff between a computer vision model's target identification accuracy and its ability to run on hardware with substantial power and weight limitations. I investigate whether the latest pretrained deeplearning models from GoogleAI were appropriate for target identication.
